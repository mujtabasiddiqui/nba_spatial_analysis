### Capstone Project for GEOG 481 performing a spatial analysis on player movements and shots in the NBA
Project by: Mujtaba Siddiqui, Praven Selvakamalan, Vibushan Thiruchelvam, George He

Using Python we hope to analyze data from the nba_api module and create charts insipired by Kirk Goldsberry's work.
Eventually using these charts in a web application that can be used as a scounting report on both player and teams.
